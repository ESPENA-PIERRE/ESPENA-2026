        <h3>Growing Up in Quezon City</h3>
        <p>
            I grew up in <strong>Quezon City</strong>, surrounded by the familiar noise of Marites and jeepney honks—the <em>rhythm of everyday life</em>. My childhood was simple, ordinary, and filled with the typical experiences many kids go through. I spent most of my days <b>playing outside</b> with my childhood friends. The streets became our playground and our <span class="highlight">world of imagination</span>, filled with countless roleplays.
        </p>

        <h3>Adventures and Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>
            I learned how to ride a bike along those roads—the same one that left me with a <span class="highlight">permanent scar on my eyebrow</span>. I remember feeling <em>excited</em> every time I explored new corners of our neighborhood, though I often got scolded for straying too far or going to <b>mosquito-filled areas</b>. My parents always reminded me to be home before dark.
        </p>

        <h3>Simple Joys and Family Bonds</h3>
        <p>
            I enjoyed small things, like buying snacks from the <strong>sari-sari store</strong> with spare change from my parents. My childhood taught me to appreciate moments of <em>peace and simplicity</em>. I often visited my grandma once a year in <b>Bicol</b>, and their home felt like a <span class="highlight">second home</span> to me. I grew up close to my family, which shaped my personality. I learned early the importance of <strong>respect and kindness</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>School Days and Friendships</h3>
        <p>
            School during those early years was <b>fun and uncomplicated</b>, making me miss the freedom and lack of responsibilities. I made friends easily, laughed a lot, and rarely worried about anything serious. I enjoyed attending school because we mainly <em>talked and played games</em>, though I disliked craft class projects.
        </p>

        <h3>Memories That Shaped Me</h3>
        <p>
            Life felt <span class="highlight">slow and gentle</span> back then. Those memories remain special and remind me of where I started and how far I've come. The streets of Quezon City, the smell of sari-sari stores, the warmth of my grandmother's home in Bicol—these are the <strong>foundations that built who I am today</strong>.

        </div>

        <h3>Entering a New Phase</h3>
        <p>
            My teenage years were <b>very different</b> from what I expected. I entered this stage without realizing I was a teenager—they just told me, <span class="quote">"Binata kana."</span> Things changed when the <strong>pandemic hit</strong>. I was in grade 8 when everything suddenly stopped. The <em>world shifted</em>, and so did my life.
        </p>

        <h3>Life During the Pandemic</h3>
        <p>
            I spent most of my teenage years <span class="highlight">inside the house</span>. My supposed happiest years were spent <b>behind screens</b>. I was in Grade 9 and 10 during the lockdown. Online classes became my new routine. It was hard to adjust at first. I missed seeing my friends and teachers. I missed physically going to school and the <em>after-school hangouts</em>. <strong>I felt like I was losing moments I could never get back.</strong>
        </p>

        <h3>Finding New Ways to Adapt</h3>
        <p>
            Despite the challenges, I learned to <b>adapt</b>. I found ways to stay connected with the people I cared about. I discovered new hobbies and interests while staying at home, including <em>video games, online entertainment, anime, and movies</em>. I also learned more about <strong>myself</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>Lessons in Uncertainty</h3>
        <p>
            The pandemic was the <span class="highlight">laziest part of my life</span>, leaving me inactive and bedridden for two years. It taught me how to handle <b>uncertainty</b>. Even though I did not fully enjoy my teenage years, they helped me grow. I came out <strong>stronger and more mature</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>Building Resilience</h3>
        <p>
            Looking back, those years taught me <b>resilience</b>. They showed me that adaptation isn't just survival—it's finding <em>new ways to thrive</em> even when the world feels upside down. My teenage years may not have been what I imagined, but they <span class="highlight">shaped me in ways I'm still discovering</span>.

<!-- COLLEGE LIFE SECTION -->
<div class="section">
    <div class="section-title">
        <h2>College Life</h2>
        <div class="section-subtitle">A Chapter of Growth and Discovery</div>
    </div>

    <div class="text-wrapper">

        <div class="image-box">
            <img src="video3.jpg" alt="College Life">
        </div>

        <h3>A New Beginning</h3>
        <p>
            College became a new chapter filled with <strong>challenges and discoveries</strong>. It was stressful from the very beginning. The first year, first semester was easy, giving me many ups, but there were moments when I felt <em>overwhelmed</em> because all the subjects seemed to have <b>deadlines and exams on the same day</b>. Yet, there were also moments when I felt <span class="highlight">proud of my progress</span>.
        </p>

        <h3>Moments of Pride</h3>
        <p>
            Once, I ranked <strong>highest in Sir Ariel's midterm exam</strong> in 1st year—a proud moment, because I thought I had choked. The next day, I was mentioned in our group chat as the <b>highest scorer</b>. <span class="highlight">That validation meant everything to me.</span> It reminded me that <em>hard work pays off</em>, even when self-doubt creeps in.
        </p>

        <h3>Friendships and Loss</h3>
        <p>
            College introduced me to people who <b>changed my life</b>. I made friends who supported me through tough times, and without them, I don't think I could handle the stress. I also <em>lost some old friends</em> along the way, including a former girlfriend. Some friendships faded as quickly as they came.
        </p>

        <h3>Learning to Let Go</h3>
        <p>
            Losing her hurt, but it taught me important lessons. I realized that <span class="highlight">not everyone is meant to stay</span>, and I learned to <strong>value those who remain</strong>. College pushed me out of my comfort zone and challenged me <em>emotionally and mentally</em>. I learned to manage stress better and <b>trust myself more</b>.
        </p>

        <h3>The Journey Continues</h3>
        <p>
            Every project, exam, and group work shaped my character. Despite everything, I found <strong>joy in small victories</strong>. My college years continue to build the person I am becoming, and I carry each lesson with me as I <em>move forward</em>.
        </p>

        <h3>Discovering Who I Am</h3>
        <p>
            The stress, the late nights, the friendships, the heartbreaks—they all weave together into a story of <b>resilience and growth</b>. College isn't just about earning a degree; it's about <span class="highlight">discovering who you are when everything feels uncertain</span>.
