            </div>

            <p>
                Imagine dating someone who keeps everything bottled up, acts like they're fine when they're clearly not, and <strong>never really opens up</strong> about their feelings. Sounds stressful, right? Now imagine that this isn't just a bad habit or a temporary phase—it's <span class="highlight">part of their personality</span>. Dating someone with an <b>avoidant attachment style</b> is not for the weak. It's a constant cycle of <em>emotional distance</em>, mixed signals, and moments where you're left asking yourself, <strong>"Are we even on the same page?"</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                When I was a child, I already had this mindset that <b>not everyone is meant to stay</b>. Because of that, I learned not to get too attached to people. I didn't do it to be cold or distant—it just felt <em>safer that way</em>. I figured that if I never got too close, it wouldn't hurt as much when someone eventually left. I still look back on memories though, both the good ones and the bad ones. Sometimes I catch myself reminiscing, feeling that quick wave of <span class="highlight">nostalgia</span>, like missing a version of life that doesn't exist anymore. But it never lasts long. I <strong>move on easily</strong>, almost automatically, like my brain is already wired to let things go before they sink in too deep.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now you're probably wondering how this even connects to the story I'm about to tell. What does my childhood mindset have to do with dating, emotions, or relationships now? Honestly—<b>everything</b>. Those habits didn't disappear as I grew older. They followed me. They just showed up differently. What started as <em>self-protection</em> slowly turned into a pattern I didn't even realize I was repeating. Before going any further, here's how that mindset shaped me:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Detachment</strong> became my way of protecting myself from disappointment and loss.</li>
                <li>The <em>closer someone gets</em>, the stronger the urge to <span class="highlight">pull away</span>.</li>
                <li><b>Nonchalance</b> became my shield—acting like I don't care, even when I do.</li>
                <li>This emotional distance slowly shaped how I approach <strong>relationships</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                In the end, I realized that the distance I feared in others was something I had been <strong>carrying within myself</strong> all along. My avoidant tendencies weren't born from cruelty or indifference, but from a <em>deep need to protect my heart</em> from being hurt again. While detachment once helped me survive, it also kept me from fully experiencing <b>love, connection, and vulnerability</b>. Admitting that I am part of the problem isn't about blame—it's about <span class="highlight">awareness</span>. And maybe with that awareness comes the chance to <strong>unlearn old defenses</strong> and slowly allow myself to stay, even when it feels uncomfortable.
